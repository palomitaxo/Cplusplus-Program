# Cplusplus-Program

The purpose of this project is to create a simple math-based program that will need to be able to print the multiplication table for a given number and double the value of a given number. I believe the structure of the program itself I did a great job and making something that was understandable and executable. My downfall could be when I write I have issue saving my drafts to my final and had an issue with correcting the file names when I am done which can lead the code to not function properly when exported. The most difficult was just trying to compute the menu to match exactly with the requirements for some reason I get issues with spacing and caught myself having to go back and forth to correct. Being able to solve math equations and flow to transfer that understanding to a program will be an indispensable tool in the future and other projects I come across. This program is flexible in its ability to weave two language into one cohesive program.
